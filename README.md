# My 3D Fidget Designs

Welcome to my collection of 3D-printed fidget designs! I created these unique fidgets to print and sell, with the goal of raising money for my school's Hack Club. Each design is provided as an `.stl` file so you can print your own fidget toys at home or with a local 3D printer.

## Fidget Designs

Below is a list of all the fidgets available, with links to the final version of each design:

- **Cone Fidget**: [Inner v3](cone_fidget/cone_fidget_inner_v3.stl), [Outer v3](cone_fidget/cone_fidget_outer_v3.stl)
- **Diamond Star Fidget**: [v4](diamond_star_fidget/diamond_star_fidget_v4.stl)
- **Hexagon Fidget**: [v1](hexagon_fidget/hexagon_fidget_v1.stl)
- **Octogon Fidget**: [v3](octogon_fidget/octogon_fidget_v3.stl)

## How to Print Your Own Fidget

1. **Download the .stl file** for the fidget you want to print (see links above).
2. **Import the `.stl` file** into your preferred 3D printing slicer software (such as Cura, PrusaSlicer, or others).
3. **Adjust print settings** as needed for your printer and filament. Recommended settings:
	- Layer height: 0.2mm
	- Infill: 10-15%
	- Material: PLA or PETG
	- Supports: As needed (all designs can be printed support-free)
4. **Slice the model** and export the `.gcode` file for your printer.
5. **Print the fidget** and enjoy!
